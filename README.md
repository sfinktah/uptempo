** Modify Temperature of certain 3D printers derived from Delta Micro Factory Corporation **

* This has only been tested on Mac OS. *

** Theory of Operation **

* Send print to printer
* Quit application
* Run this script

It would seem, that even if you re re-initialise and re-print a previous job, the temperature settings will stay.  But when printing a new job, it seems to reset temperature.
