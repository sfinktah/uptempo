Modify Temperature of certain 3D printers derived from Delta Micro Factory Corporation

Tested on Mac OS X, requires python usb library (I forget what it's called, probably py-usb).

It works like this... you first have to send the print to the printer, then quit. Then run the script.

You can initialise, "re-print last job", or what not... but if you send a new print job, it will change the temperature back to default.

You can even reload the factory application and watch the print temperature and progress and what not.
